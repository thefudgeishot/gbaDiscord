This project also requires a discord application that you can create at [discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) or you can follow this [great guide](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) on how to create a discord application and get a bot token. Further variables will need to be changed to fit your special case like the controls and the bot token.
